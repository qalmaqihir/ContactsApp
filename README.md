# ContactsApp
###### By Jawad Haider
## Instructions
13.4 (Contacts App) Create a Contacts app modeled after the Cover Viewer app (Sections 13.5 –13.6). Store the contact information in an ObservableList of Contact objects. A Contact should contain first name, last name, email and phone number properties (you can provide others).
When the user selects a contact from the contacts list, its information should display in a Grid of TextFields. As the information is modified (a Contact’s data is updated, a new Contact is added or an existing Contact is deleted), the contacts ListView should display the updates.
The ListView should display the Contact’s last names.
